We intend to predict age, gender and the big five personality traits of facebook users, given their profile picture, status updates and page likes. The project works in two steps:
1.	Training the classifiers on the data set of 9500 users 
2.	Predicting the age, gender and personality traits of new users. 


## Getting Started
Before profiling a new user, there are a couple of initial steps required to setup the system and train the models.


## Prerequisites
Other than python3.X, the project uses keras with tensorflow. Below are a few installation steps for a linux machine. 
pip3 install -U scikit-learn
pip3 install tensorflow
sudo pip3 install keras
sudo pip3 install h5py

## Training the models
The project input takes user data in the hierarchy as below:
1.	LIWC – contains the LIWC.csv file
2.	Image – contains text files in the form <userid.jpg>
3.	Profile – contains the profile.csv file
4.	Relation – contains the relation.csv file
5.	Text – contains text files in the form <userid.txt>
6.	Wiki – contains numpy wiki image files.

To train the model, train_model.py file is called. This file take the folder path as input as described above. 
python3 training\ model/train_model.py <path to input directory>
 
The training process can take a few minutes to a couple of hours depending upon the machine configuration and the number of images, on which the model is trained.

## Running the prediction script
The project can be run using:
1.	The make_prediction.py file
2.	The tcss555 script file
The program takes two files as input: the folder path for new instances (as explained above) and the folder path where the xml outputs are to be saved. 
./tcss555 -i <Path to input directory> -o <path to output directory>

Built With
1.	PyCharm - The IDE used for developement
2.	Keras – Neural networks API
